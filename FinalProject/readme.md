# DH 140/250 Final Project Proposal
## Introduction 
This final project is part of a larger research question surrounding the renewed concerns associated with nuclear arms proliferation, specifically targeting the issue of decaying nuclear deterrence and disarmament structure. At the present, the two countries that hold approximately 90% of all nuclear weapons, the U.S. and Russia, are seeing their relations deteriorate to the lowest point since the end of the Cold War. Although on January 3rd, 2022, China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. [issued a joint statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/03/p5-statement-on-preventing-nuclear-war-and-avoiding-arms-races/#:~:text=We%20affirm%20that%20a%20nuclear,and%20must%20never%20be%20fought.&text=We%20reaffirm%20the%20importance%20of,arms%20control%20agreements%20and%20commitments.) proclaiming that 
> a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,
  
matters around diminishing nuclear weapons reduction commitments continue to persist. 
  
In an age of heightened geopolitical escalation between NATO and Russia and worsening relations between the U.S. and China, a perception of lowered threshold for the use of nuclear weapons is alarming. This project seeks to track historical changes in nuclear arsenals of the U.S. and Russia, note how these changes correspond to various global and bilateral treaties, and assess the possible scope of the next U.S.-Russia treaty on nuclear nonproliferation. 
  
## Data Sources
For the first part of this project, I will use the Federation of American Scientists' [data](https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/) that outlines the U.S. and Russia's nuclear inventories from 1945 until 2021. This will allow me to see how each country's inventories changed in response to important historical events of the second half of the 20th century as well as nuclear nonproliferation treaties.
  
Another source of [data](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2017.1363995) comes from the article by Hans M. Kristensen and Robert S. Norris published in the *Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists* in 2017 and which provides nuclear weapons deployment locations around the world. While the data from 2017 is certainly useful, I will try to see if I can find updated data from 2021. This data will help visualize the locations of nuclear weapons and compare Russia's deployments with those of the U.S. 
  
## Visualizations 
With the available data, I hope to create a column chart or a line chart to compare U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenal over the period from 1945 to 2021. With the second set of data, I would like to create an area chart or a map where I can input locations of nuclear weapons belonging to the two countries in question. 
  
These visualizations would help those interacting with the project see the historical significance of global and bilateral treaties as well as understand what kind of changes need to happen in the near future in order to restrain nuclear proliferation. 

## Conclusion
This project seeks to show that although it has been over 50 years since the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) took effect and of which 191 countries are members, the threat of nuclear war has not gone away and, on the contrary, has risen in the present day. With New START covering only about 40% of the active nuclear stockpiles of the U.S. and Russia and with modernization of weapons taking place this and next decade, nuclear arsenals only continue to grow. Finally, even though there is a reduction in the number of issues on which cooperation between the U.S. and Russia can be expected, negotiating a new treaty is in Washington's and Moscow's own interest.
